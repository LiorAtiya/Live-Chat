# Live Chat Application with Angular, Node.js, and Ngrx
## Overview
This project is a real-time chat application built with Angular on the frontend, Node.js on the backend, and leveraging the power of Ngrx for state management. The application facilitates live communication between two users, with user data securely stored on the server.

## Features
* <b>Real-time Communication:</b> Experience seamless, real-time communication between two users within the application.
